# Purpose

**Poolbuddy** is designed to streamline the management of pool data and chemical balances for pool operators. The application aims to facilitate the efficient monitoring, recording, and analysis of pool conditions, ensuring optimal operational standards and safety.

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Data Management**:
    - **Data Collection**: Enable users to input and store various pool measurements such as pH levels, chlorine content, temperature, and more.
    - **Data Accessibility**: Provide quick access to the latest pool measurements and allow users to view historical data for long-term trends and analytics.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring and Reporting**:
    - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Allow users to check the current state of the pool and view the latest values at any time.
    - **Trend Analysis and Reporting**: Help users identify ongoing issues through analytics that highlight trends and changes over time.

3. **Collaborative Features**:
    - **User Notes**: Enable users to view and share notes on specific pools, fostering better communication and information sharing among team members or across different user roles.
    - **Shared Access**: Ensure that measurements and reports can be easily accessed by all relevant parties, enhancing teamwork and management efficiency.

4. **Inventory Management**:
    - **Stock Tracking**: Include features for tracking the stock levels of chemicals, equipment, and spare parts, aiding in inventory control and planning.

5. **Proactive Maintenance and Correction**:
    - **Automated Calculations**: Provide automated chemical correction suggestions based on the latest measurements and predefined pool parameters (e.g., volume, turnover rate).
    - **Correction Reminders**: Offer reminders for re-testing water quality after chemical corrections or at regular intervals (e.g., every four hours during public opening times) to maintain pool standards.

6. **User-Centric Design**:
    - **Ease of Use**: Develop an interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate, enabling users to perform tasks efficiently and without extensive training.
